# wainscot-helper-ios
A tool to help figure out Wainscot measurements.

TODO: 

- [ ] Make post width and max spacing values dynamic (using user defaults). Perhaps use a slider 
      for the max spacing and see the UI live update?
- [ ] In the UI, make the shortcuts for 3.5" and 4.125" edges dynamic
